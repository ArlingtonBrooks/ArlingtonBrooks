<h1> Welcome to ArlingtonBrooks </h1>
<hline>
<p> I haven't been posting code to GitHub since it was taken over by Microsoft (and since they implemented 'copilot' automatic code completion which steals from other people's repositories).  Nonetheless, what's here is here.  I intend to configure my own code repository on a personal website in the future, so stay tuned for information.
<p> As a Ph. D. student and systems administrator, I end up writing a lot of code.  Some of that code is research code, but some of that code is that which I can share freely.  Hopefully that which I share freely will be of use to someone other than me, but if not I haven't lost anything by sharing it anyway.  
  <h1> Future Plans</h1>
  <p> In the future, I hope to get more involved in the open source community.  Unfortunately, I am currently too swamped with graduate level classes and literary reviews that actually sitting down and maintaining code (especially for free) doesn't register on my radar.  I would like to, but I'm not sacrificing my education for the sake of it.  Once I have my Ph. D. and find somewhere to work I can then consider my open-source contributions once more.
