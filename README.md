<h1> Welcome to ArlingtonBrooks </h1>
<hline>
<p> I haven't been posting code to GitHub since it was taken over by Microsoft (and since they implemented 'copilot' automatic code completion which steals from other people's repositories).  Nonetheless, what's here is here.  I intend to configure my own code repository on a personal website in the future, so stay tuned for information.
<p> As a Ph. D. student and systems administrator, I end up writing a lot of code.  Some of that code is research code, but some of that code is that which I can share freely.  Hopefully that which I share freely will be of use to someone other than me, but if not I haven't lost anything by sharing it anyway.
