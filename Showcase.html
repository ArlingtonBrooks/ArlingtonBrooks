            <h3> Eulerian-based Moment Closures for the Modelling of Polydisperse Polykinetic Sprays </h3>
            <p> Supervised by <a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/browse?type=author&value=Groth%2C+Clinton+P.+T.">Groth, Clinton P. T.</a><br>
            <p> In this thesis, multiple Eulerian-based maximum entropy spray models for higher order velocity space are extended to allow the modelling of sprays with different sized droplets. The moment space considered includes 14 moments for fully three-dimensional physical space. Eulerian-based moment methods are possibly less expensive than Lagrangian-based particle tracking methods and yet can provide statistical information on computational grids of infinitesimal size. In particular, the 5-,10-, and 14- moment maximum entropy velocity moment closures are applied witha corresponding 5-moment maximum entropy size model coupled using the Coupled Size Velocity Moment (CSVM) method. The resulting method is applied to one-dimensional closures producing 11 coupled size and velocity moments. The numerical implementations of so-called &quotpartially&quot polydisperse versions of these spray models, whereby only bulk velocity depends on droplet size, are presented along with results for canonical particle trajectory crossing problems which demonstrate the predictive capabilities of each model.

            <h3> High-Order Maximum-Entropy Moment Closures for Modelling Polydisperse Polykinetic Liquid Sprays </h3>
            <p> Co-Authors: <a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/browse?type=author&value=Groth%2C+Clinton+P.+T.">Groth, Clinton P. T.</a>; <a href="https://pwc.ca">Xu, Hang</a>; <a href="https://pwc.ca">Hu, John T. C.</a>
            <p>The use of Eulerian-based moment closure methods for the modelling of disperse liquid sprays offers numerical advantages over other commonly used methods.  In particular, Lagrangian-based methods can be computationally expensive and efficient parallel implementations of the algorithms are often difficult to achieve when coupled with an Eulerian treatment for the background gas phase.  Eulerian-based moment methods are less expensive as the costs of solving at a minimum an eight dimensional kinetic equation for the number density function (NDF) describing the distribution of liquid droplet droplets in terms of their size and velocity is replaced by solving a coupled system of partial differential equations describing the transport of various macroscopic quantities or moments in just physical space and time.  In this study, two approximate high-order maximum-entropy-based closures in velocity space are coupled to a 5-moment maximum-entropy closure in droplet size space to model the behaviour of polydisperse polykinetic sprays.  The two approximations of the high-order 14-moment maximum-entropy closures in velocity space (14-moment in three space dimensions, 5-moment in one space dimension) considered here are an interpolative-based approach and a closure based on a bi-Gaussian approximation for the distribution function.  A coupled size velocity moment method (CSVM) is then adopted in which the size conditional velocity moments representing droplet mass and momentum are then taken to be polynomial functions of droplet size, whereas other higher-order moments are assumed to be equal for all droplet sizes.  Theoretical considerations and numerical implementation of such a &quotpartially&quot polydisperse high-order closure treatment is presented along with results for canonical particle trajectory crossing problems which demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the proposed closures.

            <h3> Micro Class (2015) </h3>
            <p> Supervised by: <a href="https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/mame/354/dr-jeff-defoe">Jeff Defoe</a>
            <p> Teammates: Richelle Dolan, Andrei Tineghe, Mitchell Campbell, Justin Abbott, David Carrick
            <p> The SAE Aero Design competition is an international competition where students from universities around the world compete to build model remote controlled aeroplanes to complete a set of pre-defined tasks.  In the 2015 micro class competition, a scoring formula was defined and each team was required to design a remote controlled aeroplane which could carry a payload secured inside of a structural compartment.  An additional constraint was that the disassembled form of the aeroplane had to fit within a tube of 6 inches diameter.  Additional points were awarded based on the length of the tube and bonus points were awarded if the team could demonstrate rapid deployment via assembling the aeroplane in under 90 seconds.  
            <p> The Windsor Aero Design team designed and built an aeroplane with a foldable wing allowing for a chord length of 6.7 inches with a wing span of 58 inches and a total aircraft length of 27.5 inches.  This aeroplane, when disassembled, was able to fit into a container of length 19.25 inches.  
            <p> One of Brooks' primary contributions to this project was his ability to translate real world properties into computer programming language.  He wrote a script in the Octave programming language which, for specified initial takeoff speed, air properties, targeted cruising speed, and aspect ratio, computed the probably competition score allowing the team to select parameters that would provide the best possible design for competition.  
            <p> The result of this project was a first place prize for the team's technical presentation and third place overall at competition.
