    <h2><a href="../conferences/cfd2021/">Computational Fluid Dynamics Society of Canada Conference (2021)</a></h2>
    In this study, two approximate high-order maximum-entropy-based closures in velocity space are coupled to a 5-moment maximum-entropy closure in droplet size space to model the behaviour of polydisperse polykinetic sprays.  The two approximations of the high-order 14-moment maximum-entropy closures in velocity space (14-moment in three space dimensions, 5-moment in one space dimension) considered here are an interpolative-based approach and a closure based on a bi-Gaussian approximation for the distribution function.
  
    <h2><a href="../conferences/rgd2022/">Rarefied Gas Dynamics Conference 2022</a></h2>
    In this study, a bi-Gaussian approximation to the number density function (NDF) is used to approximate the both the maximum-entriopy NDF and closing moment fluxes of fourth-order 14-moment maximum-entropy closure associated with fully multi-dimensional kinetic theory.
