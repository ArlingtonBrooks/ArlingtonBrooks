    <h2><a href="../projects/masc/">M.A.Sc Thesis</a></h2>
    In this thesis, multiple Eulerian-based maximum entropy spray models for higher order velocity space are extended to allow the modelling of sprays with different sized droplets. The moment space considered includes 14 moments for fully three-dimensional physical space. Eulerian-based moment methods are possibly less expensive than Lagrangian-based particle tracking methods and yet can provide statistical information on computational grids of infinitesimal size.
  
    <h2><a href="../projects/sae2015/">SAE Aero-Design Competition</a></h2>
    The Windsor Aero Design team designed and built an aeroplane with a foldable wing allowing for a chord length of 6.7 inches with a wing span of 58 inches and a total aircraft length of 27.5 inches.  This aeroplane, when disassembled, was able to fit into a container of length 19.25 inches.
