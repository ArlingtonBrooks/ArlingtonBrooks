      <description>In this study, two approximate high-order maximum-entropy-based closures in velocity space are coupled to a 5-moment maximum-entropy closure in droplet size space to model the behaviour of polydisperse polykinetic sprays.  The two approximations of the high-order 14-moment maximum-entropy closures in velocity space (14-moment in three space dimensions, 5-moment in one space dimension) considered here are an interpolative-based approach and a closure based on a bi-Gaussian approximation for the distribution function.</description>

      <description>In this thesis, multiple Eulerian-based maximum entropy spray models for higher order velocity space are extended to allow the modelling of sprays with different sized droplets. The moment space considered includes 14 moments for fully three-dimensional physical space. Eulerian-based moment methods are possibly less expensive than Lagrangian-based particle tracking methods and yet can provide statistical information on computational grids of infinitesimal size.</description>
