      <description>OptimLi is an optimization code for solving gradient and hessian-based multidimensional optimization problems. This code was started on a train as a way to kill time and improve C++ programming skills. Unfortunately, due to my lack of formal programming education, the code ended up mixing elements of C and C++ making it difficult to maintain or recommend. In 2024, I pulled this library from my repositories to either be fully rewritten or scrapped altogether.</description>
