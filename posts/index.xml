      <description>Load Balancing for Heterogeneous CFD Simulations Efficiency can be measured in many ways, and is commonly measured by Central Processing Unit (CPU) time or wall time. A metric which can also indicate efficiency can be defined as follows: the amount of computational time spent advancing the solution compared to the total amount of time spent for a given computational step; this will be referred to hereafter as the CPU Active Ratio (CAR).</description>
