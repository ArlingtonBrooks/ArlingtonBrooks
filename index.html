    <h3><a href="./projects/masc/">M.A.Sc Thesis</a></h3>
    In this thesis, multiple Eulerian-based maximum entropy spray models for higher order velocity space are extended to allow the modelling of sprays with different sized droplets. The moment space considered includes 14 moments for fully three-dimensional physical space. Eulerian-based moment methods are possibly less expensive than Lagrangian-based particle tracking methods and yet can provide statistical information on computational grids of infinitesimal size.
  
    <h3><a href="./projects/sae2015/">SAE Aero-Design Competition</a></h3>
    The Windsor Aero Design team designed and built an aeroplane with a foldable wing allowing for a chord length of 6.7 inches with a wing span of 58 inches and a total aircraft length of 27.5 inches.  This aeroplane, when disassembled, was able to fit into a container of length 19.25 inches.

<h2>Teaching Philosophy Statement</h2>
I lean towards the cognitivist mental model, however believe that some constructs within the model are incorrect.  
I believe the brain is adept at writing algorithms in the form of electrical pathways, but that information is not stored.  
My generalized view of the world as a whole is that anything we do is for the purpose of building the world we want.  
As someone who aspires to be a teacher, I would like to build a world in which students understand how to critically evaluate the information presented to them; I would like to see a world in which people think of how their own decisions will affect others who have to build off of those decisions; I would like to see a world with open collaboration.  
Most of all, I would like to see the kind of world that can be built when brilliant minds are given the tools to create a their own world that is exactly as they would like to have it.

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>I believe that the human brain does not work to store information directly; rather, my belief is that the human brain works to write algorithms that increase the chances of feeding its own reward circuitry.
This differs from the cognitivist model of the human brain in that it does not postulate the brain in terms of a classical computer.
Instead, the brain is allowed to rewire itself so that the &ldquo;input&rdquo; stimuli produce a cascade of reactions along brain pathways that have been reinforced through their use.<br>
This is not information storage, this is altering the pathways in the processor itself.<br>
Another way of viewing this is to view the pathways in the brain like hiking trails through a forest.
Hiking trails (brain pathways) which produce the greatest value to the hikers (brain signals) are used often, and will therefore be free of fallen trees and poison ivy.<br>
Hiking trails which do not produce value (or are under-used) tend to overgrow, requiring hikers to route around them in some way, or have difficulty traversing them.<br>
Therefore, the forging of a new hiking trail (brain pathway) requires a significant amount of up-front work, but will be easier to traverse once established.<br>
Conversely, hiking trails which were forged haphazardly may be easy to traverse, but do not take you to the destination you need to go.
Instead, a new pathway must be forged, and caution must be used so that the old pathway does not fall into regular use in the future.<br>
At its most fundamental level, the brain is simply a set of connections which direct electrical signals (similar to a computer processor).
By forging pathways and maintaining the correct route of information, the brain can reliably reproduce data; furthermore, new information which is related to established paths can be connected with relatively little work hopping from one path to another.</p>
